I am an Economics PhD candidate at the Paris School of Economics. I am working under the supervision of Ekaterina Zhuravskaya and Hillel Rapoport.

After doing Analysis and Policy in Economics masters at PSE in Paris, I worked as a research analyst in the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.

My research interests lie in the intersection of political economy and historical economy, with a specialisation on the history of the Soviet Union.
