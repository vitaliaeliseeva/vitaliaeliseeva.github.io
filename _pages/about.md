I am an Economics PhD candidate at the Paris School of Economics. I am working under the supervision of Ekaterina Zhuravskaya and Hillel Rapoport.

<!-- After doing Analysis and Policy in Economics masters at PSE in Paris, I worked as a research analyst in the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.  -->

I was visiting Scott Gehlbach at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy during 2024-25 academic year.

My research interests lie in the intersection of political economy and economic history, with a particular interest towards the history of the Soviet Union, as well as economics of culture and propaganda.
